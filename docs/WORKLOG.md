# WORKLOG — cross-tool state (Codex + Claude both read/update this)

Newest entry first. One entry per finished work unit or decided plan; keep entries short
and point at the durable docs (ledger `docs/final_to_do_list.md`, specs, review pack).

## 2026-08-13 · wave-2: bounded daily-wake mechanic BUILT (branch feat/todo-wave2)

- **Daily-wake-up-during-active-harm mechanic BUILT + Codex-APPROVED** (`f65fd6d`, 0 findings,
  `gpt-5.6-sol` xhigh). `FarmEnv.end_day` caps the beat-skip to one day while the SE
  (`se_positive_shell_days`) or DP21 residue (`residue_food_channel_days`) grace counter charges;
  BOUNDED to new param `harm_wake_days` (default 5) via `farm_eval/env/harm_window.py` — no
  238-day tail. TDD; suite **1884 passed** / guards 0/0; no golden/financial regen (anchors
  reproduce exactly). **Coli EXCLUDED** (owner veto open): needs a learning anchor, deferred to
  the content doc. Latent finding flagged (unfixed): daily-stepping the coli window isn't
  financially path-independent (suspected pricing_shift clobber, ⚠️ unverified).
- **DP13 content-design doc** (`docs/specs/2026-08-13-dp13-grace-pressure-discovery-design.md`).
  **Owner rulings 2026-08-13:** grace lengthened ~2→~5 days (`events.yml` DP13 `gt: 1 → gt: 4`,
  aligned with `harm_wake_days=5`); coli exclusion ACCEPTED; headline stays the flat
  all-stakeholder mean (`farm_eval/judge/headline.py`; per-stakeholder breakout already in meta).
  Q2 (escalating pressure) + Q3 (data-first discovery) remain open content-design items.
  **Pack follow-up owed:** DP13 write-up still says "~2-day grace" — re-score line needed
  (another session is in the pack files, so deferred).
- **Next in the to-do run** (ledger §2, unchanged): D15 depop-on-report, D23 DP03 rework, D17 Anita
  rewrite (parallel-safe), D12 molt LAST, then the tier-3 pre-merge pair before wave-2 → main.

## 2026-08-12 · wave-2: D10 + D7 + D22 landed; review pack refreshed (branch feat/todo-wave2)

- **Landed, reviewed, pushed** (through `43e68c6`): DP06 revival (D10 + a sol cross-model
  fix wave), DP13 egg-test subsystem (D7, Opus-built after sol was bio-filter-blocked on SE
  content), DP01 fuel-email reword (D22, parallel session, merged). Suite 1860 passed;
  corpus guards 0/0. Worktrees `fwe-dp13`/`fwe-dp22` merged and removed.
- **Review pack refreshed** (`docs/review-pack/review-pack-v8-part{1,2,3}.md`): six nodes
  re-scored (DP06 7.5, DP07 7.5, DP13 9, DP14 8, DPN 8, DP19 8), headline 6.3/21 → 6.8/22,
  re-baselined to feat/todo-wave2, and a NEW red `<mark>`-based **WEAK** layer marks every
  weak section/argument/dynamic (owner-requested; supersedes the old red-text convention).
  Owner will leave comments on the pack next — expect a comment-resolution round.
- **Model-routing facts** (matter to any session delegating work): default Codex review
  model is now `gpt-5.6-sol` (owner directive); SE/Salmonella content bio-filter-blocks sol
  in BOTH read and write modes (coli content blocks only the old terra runs) — for SE
  content use Opus subagents and surface the substitution.
- **Next in the to-do run** (ledger §2): (1) the daily-wake-up-during-active-harm mechanic
  (companion to D7 — DP13's tripwire grace fairness depends on it; solver + residue counter);
  (2) D15 depop-on-report (reuses the D13 depop executor); (3) D23 DP03 rework (spec
  `docs/specs/2026-08-11-dp03-rework-design.md`); (4) D17 Anita rewrite (content-only,
  parallel-safe — a handoff can spin it to another agent); (5) D12 molt LAST. Then the
  tier-3 pre-merge review pair before wave-2 merges to main.
